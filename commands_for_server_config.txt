Add the following as a knife.rb file in the .chef dir

current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)
log_level  :info
log_location  STDOUT
node_name "ereese" #this is the user name from the admin config on server
client_key "#{current_dir}/evanreese.pem" #this is the admin pem file from the server make sure the permissions are 600
validation_client_name "chef-validator"
validation_key "#{current_dir}/ereese_devs-validation.pem" #this is the organization verification pem file from the server make sure the permissions are 600
chef_server_url "https://test-chef-server/organizations/ereese_devs" #this is the server alias followed by hardcoded organizations followed by the unique organization name
ssl_verify_mode :verify_none
cookbook_path ["#{current_dir}/.."] #this is set depending on where your cookbooks are

You will need to add the alias to the ip address to the hosts file in /etc
the 2 pem files above must be added to the same .chef directory as the knife.rb
You will need to run

knife ssl fetch
knife ssl check 

to get the certs straightened out and onto the client
